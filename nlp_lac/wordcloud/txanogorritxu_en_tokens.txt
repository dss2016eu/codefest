Little
Red-Cap
[
Little
Red
Ridding
Hood
]
Once
upon
a
time
there
was
a
dear
little
girl
who
was
loved
by
everyone
who
looked
at
her
0
but
most
of
all
by
her
grandmother
0
and
there
was
nothing
that
she
would
not
have
given
to
the
child
.
Once
she
gave
her
a
little
cap
of
red
velvet
0
which
suited
her
so
well
that
she
would
never
wear
anything
else

so
she
was
always
called
'
Little
Red-Cap
.
'
One
day
her
mother
said
to
her
:
'
Come
0
Little
Red-Cap
0
here
is
a
piece
of
cake
and
a
bottle
of
wine

take
them
to
your
grandmother
0
she
is
ill
and
weak
0
and
they
will
do
her
good
.
Set
out
before
it
gets
hot
0
and
when
you
are
going
0
walk
nicely
and
quietly
and
do
not
run
off
the
path
0
or
you
may
fall
and
break
the
bottle
0
and
then
your
grandmother
will
get
nothing

and
when
you
go
into
her
room
0
don'
t
forget
to
say
0
``
Good
morning
''
0
and
don'
t
peep
into
every
corner
before
you
do
it
.
'
'
I
will
take
great
care
0
'
said
Little
Red-Cap
to
her
mother
0
and
gave
her
hand
on
it
.
The
grandmother
lived
out
in
the
wood
0
half
a
league
from
the
village
0
and
just
as
Little
Red-Cap
entered
the
wood
0
a
wolf
met
her
.
Red-Cap
did
not
know
what
a
wicked
creature
he
was
0
and
was
not
at
all
afraid
of
him
.
'
Good
day
0
Little
Red-Cap
0
'
said
he
.
'
Thank
you
kindly
0
wolf
.
'
'
Whither
away
so
early
0
Little
Red-Cap
?
'
'
To
my
grandmother
's
.
'
'
What
have
you
got
in
your
apron
?
'
'
Cake
and
wine

yesterday
was
baking-day
0
so
poor
sick
grandmother
is
to
have
something
good
0
to
make
her
stronger
.
'
'
Where
does
your
grandmother
live
0
Little
Red-Cap
?
'
'
A
good
quarter
of
a
league
farther
on
in
the
wood

her
house
stands
under
the
three
large
oak-trees
0
the
nut-trees
are
just
below

you
surely
must
know
it
0
'
replied
Little
Red-Cap
.
The
wolf
thought
to
himself
:
'
What
a
tender
young
creature
!
what
a
nice
plump
mouthful--she
will
be
better
to
eat
than
the
old
woman
.
I
must
act
craftily
0
so
as
to
catch
both
.
'
So
he
walked
for
a
short
time
by
the
side
of
Little
Red-Cap
0
and
then
he
said
:
'
See
0
Little
Red-Cap
0
how
pretty
the
flowers
are
about
here--why
do
you
not
look
round
?
I
believe
0
too
0
that
you
do
not
hear
how
sweetly
the
little
birds
are
singing

you
walk
gravely
along
as
if
you
were
going
to
school
0
while
everything
else
out
here
in
the
wood
is
merry
.
'
Little
Red-Cap
raised
her
eyes
0
and
when
she
saw
the
sunbeams
dancing
here
and
there
through
the
trees
0
and
pretty
flowers
growing
everywhere
0
she
thought
:
'
Suppose
I
take
grandmother
a
fresh
nosegay

that
would
please
her
too
.
It
is
so
early
in
the
day
that
I
shall
still
get
there
in
good
time
'

and
so
she
ran
from
the
path
into
the
wood
to
look
for
flowers
.
And
whenever
she
had
picked
one
0
she
fancied
that
she
saw
a
still
prettier
one
farther
on
0
and
ran
after
it
0
and
so
got
deeper
and
deeper
into
the
wood
.
Meanwhile
the
wolf
ran
straight
to
the
grandmother
's
house
and
knocked
at
the
door
.
'
Who
is
there
?
'
'
Little
Red-Cap
0
'
replied
the
wolf
.
'She
is
bringing
cake
and
wine

open
the
door
.
'
'
Lift
the
latch
0
'
called
out
the
grandmother
0
'
I
am
too
weak
0
and
cannot
get
up
.
'
The
wolf
lifted
the
latch
0
the
door
sprang
open
0
and
without
saying
a
word
he
went
straight
to
the
grandmother
's
bed
0
and
devoured
her
.
Then
he
put
on
her
clothes
0
dressed
himself
in
her
cap
laid
himself
in
bed
and
drew
the
curtains
.
Little
Red-Cap
0
however
0
had
been
running
about
picking
flowers
0
and
when
she
had
gathered
so
many
that
she
could
carry
no
more
0
she
remembered
her
grandmother
0
and
set
out
on
the
way
to
her
.
She
was
surprised
to
find
the
cottage-door
standing
open
0
and
when
she
went
into
the
room
0
she
had
such
a
strange
feeling
that
she
said
to
herself
:
'
Oh
dear
!
how
uneasy
I
feel
today
0
and
at
other
times
I
like
being
with
grandmother
so
much
.
'
She
called
out
:
'
Good
morning
0
'
but
received
no
answer

so
she
went
to
the
bed
and
drew
back
the
curtains
.
There
lay
her
grandmother
with
her
cap
pulled
far
over
her
face
0
and
looking
very
strange
.
'
Oh
!
grandmother
0
'
she
said
0
'
what
big
ears
you
have
!
'
'
The
better
to
hear
you
with
0
my
child
0
'
was
the
reply
.
'
But
0
grandmother
0
what
big
eyes
you
have
!
'
she
said
.
'
The
better
to
see
you
with
0
my
dear
.
'
'
But
0
grandmother
0
what
large
hands
you
have
!
'
'
The
better
to
hug
you
with
.
'
'
Oh
!
but
0
grandmother
0
what
a
terrible
big
mouth
you
have
!
'
'
The
better
to
eat
you
with
!
'
And
scarcely
had
the
wolf
said
this
0
than
with
one
bound
he
was
out
of
bed
and
swallowed
up
Red-Cap
.
When
the
wolf
had
appeased
his
appetite
0
he
lay
down
again
in
the
bed
0
fell
asleep
and
began
to
snore
very
loud
.
The
huntsman
was
just
passing
the
house
0
and
thought
to
himself
:
'
How
the
old
woman
is
snoring
!
I
must
just
see
if
she
wants
anything
.
'
So
he
went
into
the
room
0
and
when
he
came
to
the
bed
0
he
saw
that
the
wolf
was
lying
in
it
.
'Do
I
find
you
here
0
you
old
sinner
!
'
said
he
.
'I
have
long
sought
you
!
'
Then
just
as
he
was
going
to
fire
at
him
0
it
occurred
to
him
that
the
wolf
might
have
devoured
the
grandmother
0
and
that
she
might
still
be
saved
0
so
he
did
not
fire
0
but
took
a
pair
of
scissors
0
and
began
to
cut
open
the
stomach
of
the
sleeping
wolf
.
When
he
had
made
two
snips
0
he
saw
the
little
Red-Cap
shining
0
and
then
he
made
two
snips
more
0
and
the
little
girl
sprang
out
0
crying
:
'
Ah
0
how
frightened
I
have
been
!
How
dark
it
was
inside
the
wolf
'

and
after
that
the
aged
grandmother
came
out
alive
also
0
but
scarcely
able
to
breathe
.
Red-Cap
0
however
0
quickly
fetched
great
stones
with
which
they
filled
the
wolf
's
belly
0
and
when
he
awoke
0
he
wanted
to
run
away
0
but
the
stones
were
so
heavy
that
he
collapsed
at
once
0
and
fell
dead
.
Then
all
three
were
delighted
.
The
huntsman
drew
off
the
wolf
's
skin
and
went
home
with
it

the
grandmother
ate
the
cake
and
drank
the
wine
which
Red-Cap
had
brought
0
and
revived
0
but
Red-Cap
thought
to
herself
:
'
As
long
as
I
live
0
I
will
never
by
myself
leave
the
path
0
to
run
into
the
wood
0
when
my
mother
has
forbidden
me
to
do
so
.
'
It
also
related
that
once
when
Red-Cap
was
again
taking
cakes
to
the
old
grandmother
0
another
wolf
spoke
to
her
0
and
tried
to
entice
her
from
the
path
.
Red-Cap
0
however
0
was
on
her
guard
0
and
went
straight
forward
on
her
way
0
and
told
her
grandmother
that
she
had
met
the
wolf
0
and
that
he
had
said
'
good
morning
'
to
her
0
but
with
such
a
wicked
look
in
his
eyes
0
that
if
they
had
not
been
on
the
public
road
she
was
certain
he
would
have
eaten
her
up
.
'Well
0
'
said
the
grandmother
0
'
we
will
shut
the
door
0
that
he
may
not
come
in
.
'
Soon
afterwards
the
wolf
knocked
0
and
cried
:
'
Open
the
door
0
grandmother
0
I
am
Little
Red-Cap
0
and
am
bringing
you
some
cakes
.
'
But
they
did
not
speak
0
or
open
the
door
0
so
the
grey-beard
stole
twice
or
thrice
round
the
house
0
and
at
last
jumped
on
the
roof
0
intending
to
wait
until
Red-Cap
went
home
in
the
evening
0
and
then
to
steal
after
her
and
devour
her
in
the
darkness
.
But
the
grandmother
saw
what
was
in
his
thoughts
.
In
front
of
the
house
was
a
great
stone
trough
0
so
she
said
to
the
child
:
'
Take
the
pail
0
Red-Cap

I
made
some
sausages
yesterday
0
so
carry
the
water
in
which
I
boiled
them
to
the
trough
.
'
Red-Cap
carried
until
the
great
trough
was
quite
full
.
Then
the
smell
of
the
sausages
reached
the
wolf
0
and
he
sniffed
and
peeped
down
0
and
at
last
stretched
out
his
neck
so
far
that
he
could
no
longer
keep
his
footing
and
began
to
slip
0
and
slipped
down
from
the
roof
straight
into
the
great
trough
0
and
was
drowned
.
But
Red-Cap
went
joyously
home
0
and
no
one
ever
did
anything
to
harm
her
again
.
