Coding for language communities (http://codefest.dss2016.eu/), 

The Codefest summer lab aims to revitalise resource-scarce languages by providing them with effective tools for electronic communication and by teaching communities how to use such tools.

Aims
  * Providing resource­ scarce languages with effective everyday tools for electronic communication.
  * Bringing small languages to the fore as part of the European linguistic scenery.
  * Promoting communal work.
  * Connecting international agents.Promoting open source-based language technologies and resources.


Proposed projects:

* Behagunea: In this project we want participants to come up with possible applications of currently available NLP tools (IXA pipes, EliXA, Newsreader) and build a prototype within a couple of days. 

* Quizbowl: Multilingual question-answering for trivia games with Wikipedia as the knowledge source. In this workshop, we will develop multilingual question-answering techniques that allow for the development of a trivia game engine in your language.

* NLP for Literature Analysis and Creation

* Create a morphological analyzer for your minority language

* Enriching the ZureTTS platform with new languages

* Machine translation for lesser-resourced languages
