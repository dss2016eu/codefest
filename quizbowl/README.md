# Multilingual question answering (quiz bowl)

This is a from-scratch implementation of a Wikipedia-based Quiz Bowl engine. The code itself is language-independent and relies on Wikipedia as its main knowledge source. Specific language directories contain formatted Wikipedia data and questions as well as other tools.
